# Loops

    Syntax:
    while(condition):
        #statement

# Forloop remove unit digit
Program to remove unit digit in a number.

Example 1:

    Enter a number:4596 
    Number after removing unit digit= 459

# Forloop find unit digit
Program to find unit digit in a number.

units digit of a number is the digit in the one's place of the number. It is the rightmost digit of the number.

Example 1:

    Enter a number:545
    Unit digit in a number 5

#  Sum of unit digit

Example 1:

    Enter a number: 40
    Sum= 4
    
# Sum of digits
while loop

    Program Explanation:
    1} User must first enter the value and store it in a variable.
    2} The for loop is used and the last digit of the number is obtained by using the modulus operator.
    3} The digit is added to another variable each time the loop is executed.
    4} This loop terminates when the value of the number is 0.
    5} The total sum of the number is then printed.
    
Example 1:

    Enter a number >> 12
    Sum of digits = 3
    
Example 2:

    Enter a number >> 365
    Sum of digits = 14

# Reverse of digits
Reverse of digits

    Program Explanation:
    
    1} User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
    
    2} The for loop is used and the last digit of the number is obtained by using the modulus operator.
    
    3} The last digit is then stored at the one’s place, second last at the ten’s place and so on.
    
    4} The last digit is then removed by truly dividing the number with 10.
    
    5} This loop terminates when the value of the number is 0.
    
    6} The reverse of the number is then printed.

Example 1:

    Enter a number:548
    Reverse of digits= 845

Example 2:

    Enter a number:987
    Reverse of digits= 789

Example 3:
    
    Enter a number:739
    Reverse of digits= 937
    
# Product of digits
Product of digits

Example 1:

    Enter a number:4586
    Product of digits= 960

Example 2:

    Enter a number:325
    Product of digits= 30

Example 3:

    Enter a number:39
    Product of digits= 27
        
    

# Armstrong number
Armstrong number


    Program Explanation:
    
    1} User must enter the number and store it in a variable.
    2} The map function obtains each digit from the number and converts it to a string and stores it in a list.
    3} The second map function cubes each digit and stores it in another list.
    4} Then the sum of the cubes of the digits is found and is checked if it is equal to the original number.
    5} If the sum of the cube of digits is equal to the original number, the number is an Armstrong number.
    6} The final result is printed.

Example 1:

    Enter a number:153
    Sum= 153
    It is a Armstrong number

Example 2:

    Enter a number:125
    Sum= 134
    It is not a Armstrong number

Example 3:

    Enter a number:407
    Sum= 407
    It is a Armstrong number

Example 4:

    Enter a number:469
    Sum= 1009
    It is not a Armstrong number
