    Program Explanation:
    1} User must first enter the value and store it in a variable.
    2} The for loop is used and the last digit of the number is obtained by using the modulus operator.
    3} The digit is added to another variable each time the loop is executed.
    4} This loop terminates when the value of the number is 0.
    5} The total sum of the number is then printed.
    
        
            Enter a number >> 12
            Sum of digits = 3

            Enter a number >> 365
            Sum of digits = 14
